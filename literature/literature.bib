  abstract = {Enveloped animal viruses deliver their genetic contents into host cells by a fusion reaction between the virus membrane, which is derived from the host-cell membrane during virus budding, and the host-cell membrane. Studying the molecular mechanisms of virus membrane-fusion reactions is important, as they are paradigms for cellular membrane-fusion reactions and potential targets for antiviral therapies.The fusion reactions are driven by virus membrane-fusion proteins, which undergo a major conformational change that is triggered by interactions with the target cell. Currently, two classes of virus membrane-fusion proteins are known --- class I and class II. Class I proteins have been well characterized and refold to a hairpin conformation that drives membrane fusion.The class II membrane-fusion proteins are considered in detail, using the E1 protein of the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and the E protein of the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE) as examples.In spite of the lack of any detectable amino-acid-sequence similarity, the ectodomains of the alphavirus (E1) and flavivirus (E) fusion proteins have remarkably similar secondary and tertiary structures. Both proteins fold co-translationally with a companion protein, p62 and prM, respectively. One important difference between the viruses is that different budding sites are used --- new alphavirus virions bud from the plasma membrane, whereas flavivirus particles bud into the endoplasmic reticulum as immature virions, which are then transported via the exocytic pathway.The structure of the E1 and E proteins is considered in detail, as are the conformational changes that occur during target-membrane insertion and fusion. Unlike class I fusion proteins, which are already in trimeric form before fusion, class II proteins are dimers that must rearrange during fusion to form a stable membrane-inserted homotrimer. However, despite the fact that class I and class II proteins have very different structures, both classes refold during fusion to give a similar overall 'hairpin' conformation.Evidence suggests that class II trimers interact cooperatively during membrane insertion and fusion. A model for five-fold interactions at the fusion site, including the formation of a transient hemifusion intermediate, is proposed.It is likely that class I and II fusion proteins use the same overall mechanism, suggesting that there could be a universal mechanism of membrane fusion. The possibility that there could be further classes of membrane-fusion proteins in addition to class I and class II is discussed.},

The virus core, within a lipid bilayer, has a less-ordered structure than the external, icosahedral scaffold of 90 glycoprotein E dimers. The three E monomers per icosahedral asymmetric unit do not have quasiequivalent symmetric environments. Difference maps indicate the location of the small membrane protein M relative to the overlaying scaffold of E dimers. The structure suggests that flaviviruses, and by analogy also alphaviruses, employ a fusion mechanism in which the distal beta barrels of domain II of the glycoprotein E are inserted into the cellular membrane.},

We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for {$>$}617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including {$>$}225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.}

  abstract = {Viral glycoproteins drive membrane fusion in enveloped viruses and determine host range, tissue tropism and pathogenesis1. Despite their importance, there is a fragmentary understanding of glycoproteins within the Flaviviridae2, a large virus family that include pathogens such as hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, and numerous other human, animal and emergent viruses. For many flaviviruses the glycoproteins have not yet been identified, for others, such as the hepaciviruses, the molecular mechanisms of membrane fusion remain uncharacterized3. Here we combine phylogenetic analyses with protein structure prediction to survey glycoproteins across the entire Flaviviridae. We find class II fusion systems, homologous to the Orthoflavivirus E glycoprotein in most species, including highly divergent jingmenviruses and large genome flaviviruses. However, the E1E2 glycoproteins of the hepaciviruses, pegiviruses and pestiviruses are structurally distinct, may represent a novel class of fusion mechanism, and are strictly associated with infection of vertebrate hosts. By mapping glycoprotein distribution onto the underlying phylogeny, we reveal a complex evolutionary history marked by the capture of bacterial genes and potentially inter-genus recombination. These insights, made possible through protein structure prediction, refine our understanding of viral fusion mechanisms and reveal the events that have shaped the diverse virology and ecology of the Flaviviridae.},

Isolates from this genus can be divided into four genogroups--A, B, and C, as well as a more distantly related sister group, ``tortoise''. Sequences from large portions (5.3 kb) of the genomes of a variety of ferlavirus isolates from genogroups A, B, and C, including the genes coding the surface glycoproteins F and HN as well as the L protein were determined and compared. In silico analyses of the glycoproteins of genogroup A, B, and C isolates were carried out. Three isolates representing these three genogroups were used in transmission studies with corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus), and clinical signs, gross and histopathology, electronmicroscopic changes in the lungs, and isolation of bacteria from the lungs were evaluated. Analysis of the sequences supported the previous categorization of ferlaviruses into four genogroups, and criteria for definition of ferlavirus genogroups and species were established based on sequence identities (80\% resp. 90\%). Analysis of the ferlavirus glycoprotein models showed parallels to corresponding regions of other paramyxoviruses. The transmission studies showed clear differences in the pathogenicities of the three virus isolates used. The genogroup B isolate was the most and the group A virus the least pathogenic. Reasons for these differences were not clear based on the differences in the putative structures of their respective glycoproteins, although e.g. residue and consequential structure variation of an extended cleavage site or changes in electrostatic charges at enzyme binding sites could play a role. The presence of bacteria in the lungs of the infected animals also clearly corresponded to increased pathogenicity. This study contributes to knowledge about the structure and phylogeny of ferlaviruses and lucidly demonstrates differences in pathogenicity between strains of different genogroups.},

Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the membrane anchor domain of NS5A as determined by NMR spectroscopy. An alpha-helix extending from amino acid residue 5 to 25 was observed in the presence of different membrane mimetic media. This helix exhibited a hydrophobic, Trprich side embedded in detergent micelles, while the polar, charged side was exposed to the solvent. Thus, the NS5A membrane anchor domain forms an in-plane amphipathic alpha-helix embedded in the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane bilayer. Interestingly, mutations affecting the positioning of fully conserved residues located at the cytosolic surface of the helix impaired HCV RNA replication without interfering with the membrane association of NS5A. In conclusion, the NS5A membrane anchor domain constitutes a unique platform that is likely involved in specific interactions essential for the assembly of the HCV replication complex and that may represent a novel target for antiviral intervention.},

  abstract = {Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a global public health concern and is distinct from other flaviviruses in many aspects, for example, causing transplacental infection, fetal abnormalities and vector-independent transmission through body fluids in humans. The capsid (C) protein is a multifunctional protein, since it binds to viral RNA in the process of nucleocapsid assembly and plays important roles in virus infection processes by interacting with cellular proteins, modulating cellular metabolism, apoptosis and immune response. Here we solved the crystal structure of ZIKV C protein at a resolution of 1.9{\AA}. The ZIKV C protein structure contains four {$\alpha$} helices with a long pre-{$\alpha$}1 loop and forms dimers. The unique long pre-{$\alpha$}1 loop in ZIKV C contributes to the tighter association of dimeric assembly and renders a divergent hydrophobic feature at the lipid bilayer interface in comparison with the known C structures of West Nile and dengue viruses. We reported the interaction between the ZIKV C protein and lipid droplets through confocal microscopy analysis. Substitutions of key amino acids in the pre-{$\alpha$}1 loop of ZIKV C disrupted the interaction with lipid droplets, indicating that the loop is critical for membrane association. We also recognized that ZIKV C protein possesses broad binding capability to different nucleotide types, including single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs or DNAs. Furthermore, the highly positively charged interface, mainly formed by {$\alpha$}4 helix, is proposed to be responsible for nucleotide binding. These findings will greatly enhance our understanding of ZIKV C protein, providing information for anti-ZIKV drug design targeting the C protein.},

  abstract = {Viruses of the family Flaviviridae are important pathogens of humans and other animals and are currently classified into four genera. To better understand their diversity, evolutionary history, and genomic flexibility, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to search for the viruses related to the Flaviviridae in a range of potential invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Accordingly, we recovered the full genomes of five segmented jingmenviruses and 12 distant relatives of the known Flaviviridae (``flavi-like'' viruses) from a range of arthropod species. Although these viruses are highly divergent, they share a similar genomic plan and common ancestry with the Flaviviridae in the NS3 and NS5 regions. Remarkably, although these viruses fill in major gaps in the phylogenetic diversity of the Flaviviridae, genomic comparisons reveal important changes in genome structure, genome size, and replication/gene regulation strategy during evolutionary history. In addition, the wide diversity of flavi-like viruses found in invertebrates, as well as their deep phylogenetic positions, suggests that they may represent the ancestral forms from which the vertebrate-infecting viruses evolved. For the vertebrate viruses, we expanded the previously mammal-only pegivirus-hepacivirus group to include a virus from the graceful catshark (Proscyllium habereri), which in turn implies that these viruses possess a larger host range than is currently known. In sum, our data show that the Flaviviridae infect a far wider range of hosts and exhibit greater diversity in genome structure than previously anticipated., IMPORTANCE The family Flaviviridae of RNA viruses contains several notorious human pathogens, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C virus. To date, however, our understanding of the biodiversity and evolution of the Flaviviridae has largely been directed toward vertebrate hosts and their blood-feeding arthropod vectors. Therefore, we investigated an expanded group of potential arthropod and vertebrate host species that have generally been ignored by surveillance programs. Remarkably, these species contained diverse flaviviruses and related viruses that are characterized by major changes in genome size and genome structure, such that these traits are more flexible than previously thought. More generally, these data suggest that arthropods may be the ultimate reservoir of the Flaviviridae and related viruses, harboring considerable genetic and phenotypic diversity. In sum, this study revises the traditional view on the evolutionary history, host range, and genomic structures of a major group of RNA viruses.},
